# Css-Web-Resources


This template repository contains open-source css resources gatheredd from a variety of sources. I am trying to find all the css effects in a site online. I also try viewing a paticular site and try that effect. 
 
This is kind of a copy-paste effect. You can just copy the source code and paste it in your site or page-source and change the paticular elements you want. Contribute to my repository if you have any effects I still have not put. 

For those who want to apply these effects right now without navigating between source codes, In this readme I have  provided the previw of what you are making and an image of the source codes.

View some of the effects and animations [here](https://projects-aryankapoor.netlify.app/)

The repository till now contains the following CSS effects:

The navigation bar has also been gathered from an open-source YouTube channel - Traversy Media.

I have also made a drop down navigation bar for my site myself. 
The names on the navigation bar have hover effect.
