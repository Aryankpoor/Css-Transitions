# Css-Web-Resources


- [ ] Is this compatible with IE?        
###  his template repository contains open-source css resources gathered from a variety of sources. I am trying to find all the css effects in a site online. I also try viewing a paticular site and try that effect. 
 
### This is kind of a copy-paste effect. You can just copy the teamplates and apply them in your project or site. They are open-source.Contribute to my repository if you have any effects I still have not put. 


View some of the effects and animations [here](https://projects-aryankapoor.netlify.app/)

The repository till now contains the following CSS effects:



## 1. CSS DYNAMIC NAVIGATION BAR

The navigation bar has also been gathered from an open-source YouTube channel - Kevin Powell.

I have also made a drop down navigation bar for my site myself. 
The names on the navigation bar have hover effect.

This moving-box animation has also been gathered from YouTube but don't remember the video. Maybe in future I will edit this readme when I find out the video.

I have put this animation in my project site.
I actually wanted to edit it so that the color would change and the shape would be some other but I did not have much time, I was working on some other project.
