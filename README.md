# Css-Web-Resources

## SOME COMMON QUESTIONS
- [x] Does this contain CSS animations
- [ ] Is this compatible with IE?         (OBVIOUSLY NOT INTERNET EXPLORER IS BEING SHUT DOWN BY MICROSOFT NOW)
- [ ] Did you make all this?              (No but I have credited the original authors)
- [x] Will more be uploaded?

This template repository contains open-source css resources gatheredd from a variety of sources. I am trying to find all the css effects in a site online. I also try viewing a paticular site and try that effect. 
 
This is kind of a copy-paste effect. You can just copy the source code and paste it in your site or page-source and change the paticular elements you want. Contribute to my repository if you have any effects I still have not put. 

For those who want to apply these effects right now without navigating between source codes, In this readme I have  provided the previw of what you are making and an image of the source codes.

View some of the effects and animations [here](https://projects-aryankapoor.netlify.app/)

The repository till now contains the following CSS effects:



## 1. CSS DYNAMIC NAVIGATION BAR

The navigation bar has also been gathered from an open-source YouTube channel - Traversy Media.

I have also made a drop down navigation bar for my site myself. 
The names on the navigation bar have hover effect.

This moving-box animation has also been gathered from YouTube but don't remember the video. Maybe in future I will edit this readme when I find out the video.

I have put this animation in my project site.
I actually wanted to edit it so that the color would change and the shape would be some other but I did not have much time, I was working on some other project.
